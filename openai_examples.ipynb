      "Question: Following the Five Precepts, practicing meditation, using Buddha's teachings as a refuge, and trying to be mindful throughout the day, but not being able to do it often. When I see my own weaknesses, I become aware of my breath and turn to Buddha. I see my thoughts going back and forth. When I get angry, I can't control myself well. After the anger subsides, I feel a lot of suffering and remorse. How can I control anger?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: We can't control it. But if we see that when we get angry, what follows is suffering. We frequently see suffering, and our mind does not want it. It sees suffering and blame. The mind gradually relaxes. When we get angry at someone, the first person to suffer and the last person to suffer is ourselves. It suffers. Don't try to fix it. The more we try to fix it, the stronger it gets. When anger arises, we know it. When it goes away, we know it. If we get angry and then break a precept, like scolding someone, we must face the consequences. Facing the consequences does not resolve the situation. When we get angry and scold someone, they will dislike us. When our mind is in a bad mood, we say that person used to be like this. The mind will think of that person more quickly. This is our accumulated consequences. We will be a bad person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, we rely on mindfulness. When anger arises, we know it. We immediately prevent ourselves from violating precepts. Then, the mind becomes sad and sulks. We see suffering and blame. Oh, there is a desire and we engage in unwholesome actions. There is an accumulation of sorrow. We can't fix it. We must face it. As the mind moves forward, it will become sharper and more aware. Oh, when we get angry, it is suffering every time. Seeing this, we should stop being angry ourselves. Being serious about life too much is not good. We are tired. We are serious about life, and we ourselves are tired. People around us are also tired. \"Ease up a little, ease up a little,\" keep saying that. Oh, this kind of mind is good. Then the people around us, huh, newsflash, they'll see it. The mind is happy. It's easy like this. Look at it. The more we ponder on it, the more stressed we become.\n"

      "Question: I uphold the five precepts and meditate regularly, using Buddha as my sanctuary. Throughout the day, I try to be mindful but often struggle. When I become aware of my own defilements, my attention goes to my breathing and practicing the recitation of Buddha. I find my thought patterns changing. When I am angered, I struggle to control myself, and after the anger dissipates, I suffer greatly. How can I control my anger better?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: It's not really about control. But if we observe that the result of our anger is suffering, and we see this frequently, our mind will naturally reject it. It will see the suffering, realize the harm, and begin to let go. When we're angry at others, the person who suffers first and last is ourselves. There is no need to try to fix this, the more we desire to fix it, the more tense we'll be. You will know when the anger arises and when it dissipates. If your anger causes you to break the precepts, like insulting someone, you must face the consequences. There's no fixing breaking the precept; if we're angry and we insult others, they will inevitably dislike us. When we are in a bad mood, we tend to judge others, and the more frequently this happens, the quicker our mind judges others. This is a consequence of our own actions and will make us an unpleasant person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, we should rely on mindfulness. When anger arises, know it. If we're not mindful, we might violate the precepts and then feel disheartened. We see the suffering and the harm in this. Oh, when defilements cause us to carry out bad actions, there are disheartening consequences that we cannot fix, we must bear them. Then the mind will slowly become weary, like \"Oh, every time I get angry, I suffer every time\". When you see this, eventually anger will dissipate on its own. Taking life too seriously can be detrimental, it’s tiresome. We tire ourselves out, and tire those around us as well. Take it easy a bit, let it be. A mind like that will be happier, and then people around us would also feel more at ease. Do you see? This is how the mind finds happiness, in this simple way, let the observing go on. The more you push it the more tense you will be.\n"

      "Question: I observe the five precepts, practice walking and sitting meditation, and use Buddha as a refuge. Throughout the day, I try to be aware but I am not often successful. When I notice my defilements, I would focus on my breath and recite the name of the Buddha. I see my thoughts fluctuating. When I am angry, I can't control myself well. After the anger has passed, there is a lot of suffering and torment. How can I manage my anger?\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "Answer: You can't really control it. But if we see that after anger, there comes suffering. If you see this often, the mind will not want it. It sees suffering, it sees the harm, and the mind will gradually loosen up. When we are angry at others, the first person who suffers and the last person who suffers is ourselves. It's suffering. You don't need to fix it. The more you want to fix it, the more forceful the suppression becomes. If you get angry and know it, if you stop being angry and know it, that's good. If you get angry and violate precepts, like scolding others, that you must bear the consequences. You can't fix the consequences. Like when we get angry and scold someone, they will dislike us. When our mood is bad, we will blame this person, blame that person... as a habit, the mind will blame people faster and faster. This is the consequence that we accumulate, we will become bad people. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, we should be mindful. When anger rises, recognize it. If you don't recognize it in time and violate the precepts, your mind will be dejected. We will see the pain and the harm. Oh, having defilements and committing bad deeds, there will be consequences that are dejected. You can't fix the consequences, you have to accept it. And then the mind will be cautious. Oh, everytime I get angry, I suffer every time. When you see this, you will let go of your anger. Taking life too seriously is not good, it's exhausting. If we take life too seriously, we get tired, people around us get tired too. Relax a bit. Just like this, the mind would be better, and people around us, oh, like a 7 (Thai idiom meaning to be relaxed). You see? The mind is happier. It's simple like this. Keep looking. The more you press it, the more stressed it becomes.\n"
